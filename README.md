# NFT-Marketplace
## This is a basic project that let's you mint one NFT per user.

## The smart contract is deployed on Goerli testnet. Due to ETH merge, Rinkeby testnet will be deprecated soon.
## Smart Contract Address : [0xd18332fD9196F23082D38139390082AFC5EF009b](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd18332fD9196F23082D38139390082AFC5EF009b).
## The contract can be found [here](https://github.com/ParthVarde/NFT-Marketplace/blob/main/hardhat-module/contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol).

## To interact with the smart contract, I have used [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).
## Another very good alternative for interactions with Ethereum Blockchain would be [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.0/).
